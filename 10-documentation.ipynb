    "# Introdução\n",
    "\n",
    "A retenção de clientes é um desafio estratégico fundamental para empresas \n",
    "de telecomunicações no mercado competitivo atual. O **churn** (evasão de clientes)\n",
    "representa não apenas perda de receita imediata, mas também o custo elevado\n",
    "de aquisição de novos clientes para substituir os perdidos [@Smith2023].\n",
    "\n",
    "Este estudo investiga padrões comportamentais que precedem a decisão de \n",
    "cancelamento, utilizando técnicas avançadas de ciência de dados para \n",
    "desenvolver um modelo preditivo robusto.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objetivos\n",
    "\n",
    "Os objetivos específicos desta análise incluem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identificar** os principais fatores associados ao churn\n",
    "2. **Desenvolver** um modelo preditivo com alta acurácia\n",
    "3. **Propor** estratégias de retenção baseadas em dados\n",
    "4. **Validar** a eficácia das técnicas aplicadas\n",
    "\n",
    "# Metodologia\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conjunto de Dados\n",
    "\n",
    "O dataset utilizado compreende **1.000 registros** de clientes com as \n",

    "> \n",
    "> **Médio Risco**: Clientes estabelecidos com queda na satisfação\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Verdadeiros Positivos**: 85 clientes com churn corretamente identificados\n",
    "- **Falsos Positivos**: 12 clientes incorretamente classificados como churn\n",

    "# Discussão\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insights Principais\n",
    "\n",
    "Os resultados confirmam hipóteses importantes sobre comportamento de churn:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relacionamento Temporal\n",
    "\n",
    "Clientes com **menos de 6 meses** apresentam probabilidade de churn 3x maior\n",
    "que clientes estabelecidos. Isso sugere a importância crítica do período\n",
    "de *onboarding* e primeiros meses de relacionamento.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indicadores de Insatisfação\n",
    "\n",
    "A frequência de contatos com suporte emerge como preditor robusto, \n",
    "especialmente quando combinada com avaliações negativas em pesquisas\n",
    "de satisfação.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensibilidade a Preço\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrariamente ao esperado, o valor mensal não é o fator determinante\n",
    "isoladamente, mas sim quando combinado com percepção de valor baixo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitações do Estudo\n",
    "\n",
    "É importante reconhecer algumas limitações:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dados sintéticos**: Simulação pode não capturar toda complexidade real\n",
    "- **Período temporal**: Análise de snapshot, sem evolução temporal\n",
    "- **Fatores externos**: Concorrência e sazonalidade não considerados\n",
    "- **Segmentação**: Modelo geral, sem customização por segmentos\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusões e Recomendações\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principais Conclusões\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Viabilidade Técnica**: É possível prever churn com 89% de acurácia\n",
    "2. **Fatores Críticos**: Tempo de relacionamento e suporte são determinantes\n",
    "3. **Janela de Oportunidade**: Primeiros 6 meses são críticos\n",
    "4. **Modelo Robusto**: XGBoost demonstrou melhor performance geral\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recomendações Estratégicas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementação Imediata\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deploy do Modelo**: Implementar XGBoost em ambiente de produção\n",
    "2. **Monitoramento**: Dashboard com score de risco por cliente\n",
    "3. **Alertas Automáticos**: Notificações para clientes de alto risco\n",
    "4. **Validação Contínua**: Reavaliar modelo mensalmente\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ações de Retenção\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Programa de Onboarding Intensivo**\n",
    "   - Acompanhamento personalizado nos primeiros 90 dias\n",
    "   - Check-ins proativos e treinamento de uso\n",
    "   - Ofertas especiais para novos clientes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Melhoria no Atendimento**\n",
    "   - Reduzir tempo de resposta em 50%\n",
    "   - Implementar chat proativo\n",
    "   - Treinamento específico para retenção\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pesquisas de Satisfação Ativas**\n",
    "   - Surveys automáticos pós-interação\n",
    "   - NPS contínuo com follow-up\n",
    "   - Ação imediata para scores baixos\n",
    "\n",
    "### Roadmap de Melhorias\n",
    "\n",
    "**Curto Prazo (3 meses)**:\n",
    "- Implementação do modelo em produção\n",
    "- Treinamento das equipes comerciais\n",
    "- Campanhas piloto de retenção\n",
    "\n",
    "**Médio Prazo (6 meses)**:\n",
    "- Personalização por segmentos\n",
    "- Integração com sistemas CRM\n",
    "- Análise de ROI das ações\n",
    "\n",
    "**Longo Prazo (12 meses)**:\n",
    "- Modelos preditivos avançados\n",
    "- Análise de séries temporais\n",
    "- IA conversacional para retenção\n",
    "\n",
    "## Impacto Esperado\n",
    "\n",
    "Com base em benchmarks da indústria [@Hastie2009], estimamos:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Redução de 25%** na taxa de churn\n",
    "- **Aumento de 15%** no lifetime value\n",
    "- **ROI de 300%** em campanhas direcionadas\n",
    "- **Melhoria de 20%** no NPS geral\n",

    "\n",
    "Este notebook demonstrou na prática os **seis métodos principais** para geração de PDFs em projetos de Ciência de Dados:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Principais Aprendizados\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Não existe método único ideal** - a escolha depende do contexto\n",
    "2. **LaTeX oferece qualidade superior** - mas com complexidade adicional\n",
    "3. **WebPDF é excelente para visualizações interativas** - processo mais simples\n",
    "4. **Quarto e Jupyter Book são ideais para documentos extensos** - qualidade editorial\n",
    "5. **Pandoc oferece máxima flexibilidade** - mas requer workflow estruturado\n",
    "6. **Navegador é útil para prototipagem** - rápido mas limitado\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Recomendação Geral\n",
    "\n",
    "Para **iniciantes**: Comece com **nbconvert WebPDF** ou **impressão pelo navegador**\n",
    "\n",
    "Para **usuários avançados**: Explore **Quarto** para versatilidade ou **Pandoc** para controle total\n",
    "\n",
    "Para **documentos formais**: Use **Jupyter Book** ou **Pandoc + LaTeX**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Próximos Passos\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Experimente cada método com seus próprios dados\n",
    "2. Configure templates personalizados\n",
    "3. Automatize seus workflows preferidos\n",
    "4. Integre com sistemas de versionamento (Git)\n",
    "5. Explore recursos avançados de cada ferramenta\n",
